BODY.GAME.RESULTS.GAMESTART.WDO=Hey,\nGame {0} - T{1} - {2} has started. Deadline to submit new actions by {3}. \nWelcome to the Clash of the Legends. I appreciate the time you take to play this fan homage to great stories.\nThis game is a weekly team game limited to {5} turns on Tolkien\u2019s War of Dwarves and Orcs scenario for {6} players with custom startup packages... Meaning that the game ends when one of the victory conditions are met or {5} turns have passed.  \nCustom startup packages means that each nation may choose 90 points from the list of available packages. If the selection is not valid, the Judge will select random packages for the nation. Note that most packages are not cumulative, usually the best bonus will be used.\n==== Special message for WDO beta games ====\nWelcome to the 1st beta of the new scenario, Tolkien\u2019s War of Dwarves and Orcs Circa 2973. \nMany things are different, and I will try to point them out as we go.\nFirst difference you will note is the unique setup.\nEach game starts with different nation combinations (out of 37 available). And starting locations are unique as well, as any nation can select any starting location for this scenario variant.\nAdd to the above, that the Judge selects about 200 magic items from ~1000 that are available... \nAnd all new startup packages selection can be found under the Nations tabs (like nation orders).\n\nOne other thing easy to notice is that we still use old army icons, that will change in the future once we find a designer to create 37 new icons...\n\nIf your nation didn't receive Tolkien names, is because we still need to select a few. We are using this spreadsheet to track names creation: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZiMV-CrsM1KFQCgI76jIsqjCs0Gr9nK-QdOnfk7myXY/edit?usp=sharing\n\nA few big game mechanics change to pay attention to:\n-Combat and movement are combined into one milestone. Combat happens later in the turn as part of the movement.\n-Economy is much simpler and nations cannot be eliminated because they don't have money to pay for upkeep. But troops will disband if they are not paid and loyalty will drop with higher taxes.\n-Cities can receive orders lie create roads, manage taxes, etc.\n-All PCs have the same skill classes. They are all multi commander/rogues and have access to all PC orders. (not city or nation orders, of course).\n-No water movement, no ships.\n-And more.\n\nAlso, we only have a few encounters and NPCs at this time. But we will take your feedback and suggestions, combined with the game slower pace than the previous, to create more than a few encounters.\n\nRemember, this is a big departure from other scenarios, things are supposed to go wrong (ok, they are not, but they will... I'm sure). Report everything that looks suspicious. It will help us to fix bugs and improve rules and FAQs for the next games.\n\nAnd keep an eye on game balance as you play, your suggestions will help fine tune the scenario for the next games.\n\nThe idea is to have many variants in the future. One with locked stating positions for a higher fidelity to Tolkien's books. Different combos and combinations, with different number of players. For now, let's focus on this one.\n=========\nYou can find your turn results file attached. There is a PDF attached for you to have access to your results from anywhere.\nThe game*.rr.egf file contains all results and information. You should use the Counselor to open it. The Counselor is also the program you use to edit/type your orders and submit them to the Judge. \nIf you find any problems sending your commands from the Counselor, it is ok to go to our website and upload the orders there. \nIMPORTANT: order*.rc.egf file is the only format we can receive commands. We will not process turns received in any other formats.\n\nFirst steps for a new player:\n-Make sure you join the announcements maillist. We use the list for announcements, rule changes and a few players\u2019 discussions. https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clashoflegends \n-Friend us on Facebook. It helps to bring more players as it shows the force of our community and you can see some trivia information and other stuff. Also, it will be used to identify if a fake account was created. http://www.facebook.com/clash.legends\n-Go to the download section of the website and get the Counselor. Make sure you have Java installed and that you can run the Counselor. \n-Also from the download page, check the Player reference sheet and Scenario rules.\n-Check the Beginners section of our site: https://sites.google.com/site/clashlegends/beginners\n-Read the FAQ section of our site: https://sites.google.com/site/clashlegends/faq\n\nEach scenario would have different classes, different actions, maps, troop \u2026 everything can change.  Don\u2019t assume that one scenario is like the other.\n\nA communication will be sent out if anything different than that. If a bug is found, it will be fixed for the future. We try not to re-run turns as much as we can. And also we limit the edits to a minimum. Trust the GM team and their judgment, even when it seems unfair.\n\nThe general rules section on the website explains the overall game mechanics. \n\nFew big items to note are:\n\n-There are really unique troops for each nation. And troops will behave different in each terrain. i.e. 1000 infantry will lose to 1000 cavalry on plains and easily win on mountains. This adds another layer of strategy and planning to your recruiting.\n\n-The classes may seem similar between different scenarios, but they are not. Make sure you understand what each class can do.\n\n-A player interacts with NPC with the regular actions, no special action to react to encounters. Try following, offering magic items, running away, etc... Many factors will affect NPC behavior, such as relationship between nations, PC class, if the wall is destroyed, etc...\n\n-If an army commander is killed, the army does not disband, instead it becomes a garrison. A garrison does not move or recruit and a new commander can take over control of it.\n\n-Don\u2019t trust you always get what you expect from the market. Sales are unreliable and limited.\n\n-If you move your navy an attack, you can just sail away without picking up the ships first. This will happen automatically.\n\n-Check each troop to see what they can do, they are really unique and with different powers, costs, etc.\n\n-Back on combat, your tactics will define which troops die first. Check the tables at the end of rules pdf or in the Counselor.\n\n-On the Counselor. It tries to filter out the possible actions. But it always considers the turn status at the beginning of the turn. So some action combos such as creating an army and marching will not be enabled by default. To go around this limitation, you can check the \u201cALL\u201d box and disable the filters. It will enable all actions without any situational filtering.\n\nEach faction will have strengths and weaknesses, so play to your strengths. If you find something too different or have any ideas on how to improve the game, please do send them to me. You will see that the game is under constant evolution and each new game will be adjusted based on player\u2019s feedback.\n\nIt is also important to point that the game is all about fun. A player can play as many games as he or she wants, even play with more than one nation in the same game with a few exceptions such as death match games. Failing to submit your turn spoils the fun for other players. Therefore, not sending the first turn or failing to submit more than one turn in a week without an explanation to the GMs will put the player in a timeout status. This also can be motive for transferring the nations to other players or AI, depending on GMs judgment.\n\nHave fun, check things and send suggestions on how to improve!\n\n{4}\n\nGM Team\nAll feedback is much appreciated.\nwww.clashlegends.com\nwww.facebook.com/clash.legends\n
